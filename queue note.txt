I don'know about the queue and dequeue so I need to practice that first for solving this problem

yeah I done some of the Geeks for geeks so that now I know about the constructors and queue and dequeue problems

for queue can be implement by using list or collection.queue or Queue.queue 

so example problems for implementing the queue 
 
first by using list
	
	queue=[]
	queue.append(1)
	queue.append(2)
	queue.append(3)
	print(queue)	
	queue.pop(1)
	print(queue)
	[1,2,3]
	[2,3] 
	so why can't most them not using list to do queue because it has slight use time comple than compare to other 

next using collection
	
	from collection import deque
	 
	q=deque()
	q.append(1)
	q.popleft()

next using Queue.queue

        from Queue import queue
	q=queue()
	q.put(1)
	q.get(1)


these are the thing which I need to know 
but one thing I need to know was the class and the init function 
yeah peace
